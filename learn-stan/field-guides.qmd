## Field Guides

These guides provide applied researchers with 
curated lists of tutorials, case studies, and resources
which contain Stan implementations of the most commonly used models in their domain.
If you would like to contribute one for your field,
see this announcementas announced:  [Fostering Stan user communities through domain-specific resource pages ](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/fostering-stan-user-communities-through-domain-specific-resource-pages/11544)

## StanConnect Sessions

StanConnect is a virtual miniseries which consists of 3-hour meetings/mini-symposia
where each meeting is like "session" of an organized conference.
This series was started in 2021 and reprised in 2022.
Future StanConnect series will be announced on [Discourse](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/tag/stanconnect).
