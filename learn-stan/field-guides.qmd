# Domain-Specific Resources

## Field Guides

Topic Guides list tutorials, case studies, and resources for specific fields.
They provide working examples of Stan implementations of commonly used models for that domain.
If you would like to contribute one for your field,
see this announcementas announced:  [Fostering Stan user communities through domain-specific resource pages ](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/fostering-stan-user-communities-through-domain-specific-resource-pages/11544)
