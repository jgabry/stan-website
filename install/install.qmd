::: {.callout-note}
Conda simplifies the installation process by ensuring that all required libraries and tools are compatible with each other
and is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows platforms.

You can either install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), a free, minimal installer for conda
or you can get the full [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) system
which provides graphical installer wizards for [MacOS](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#macos){target="_blank"}
and [Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#windows){target="_blank"} users.

Julia users can install [Conda.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/Conda.jl){target="_blank"}.
:::

## Prerequisite:  C++17 toolchain


Stan requires a C++17 compiler and the GNU Make utility.

* On Linux, these are bundled into the meta-package `build-essential`.
To install, run command:\
`sudo apt-get install build-essential`


* On Mac, the Clang compiler and GNU Make are included with Xcode, the Apple toolset for software developers.
Install Xcode from the App Store and then run command:\
`xcode-select --install`

\tightlist
* On Windows 10, there are two ways to get a Stan-compatible C++ toolchain:
   + Use the conda installer for CmdStan, CmdStanPy or CmdStanR or RStan, since these packages all include the required toolchain.
   + Get [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/){target="_blank"}
which includes a C++17 compiler, GNU Make for windows, and a few Unix utilities.\
CmdStanR users can call the internal function `cmdstanr:::install_toolchain`.\
CmdStanPy provides both the function `cmdstanpy::get_cxx_toolchain` and command line script `get_cxx_toolchain`.

## Local CmdStan installations for CmdStanPy, CmdStanR, and Stan.jl

CmdStanPy, CmdStanR, and Stan.jl and require a local CmdStan installation.
Both CmdStanPy and CmdStanR provide method `install_cmdstan` to do this from within Python or R;
and CmdStanPy also provides this as a command-line function.
See the online documentation:

* CmdStanPy:  [install_cmdstan function](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanpy/installation.html#function-install-cmdstan)
* CmdStanR: [install_cmdstan function](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/reference/install_cmdstan.html)
* Stan.jl [build instructions](https://github.com/StanJulia/Stan.jl/blob/master/INSTALLING_CMDSTAN.md)

The default installation location is in the user's home directory and is named `.cmdstan` (a hidden directory).
This directory contains one or more versions of CmdStan.

Both CmdStanPy and CmdStanR provide the following functions:

* `rebuild_cmdstan` - rebuild the specified release.  On Mac, often required after an Xcode update.
* `show_versions` - shows all installed CmdStan versions
* `cmdstan_path` - shows which version of CmdStan is being used
* `set_cmdstan_path` - specify which version of CmdStan to use.

## Other Stan Interfaces {#other-packages}

* Google Colab - prebuilt CmdStan binaries for Google Colab are available from the [GitHub CmdStan releases page](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases){target="_blank"}.
Installing these binaries at the start of a Colab session is much faster than installing CmdStan during a Colab session.

* MathematicaStan - available from GitHub repository:  https://github.com/stan-dev/MathematicaStan

* MatlabStan - installation instructions available on the [MatlabStan wiki](https://github.com/brian-lau/MatlabStan/wiki){target="_blank"}

* PyStan is available from via pip, run commmand:  `python -m pip install pystan`.

::: {.callout-note}
As of Release 3.10.0, PyStan is no longer being actively supported.

## High-level Stan Interfaces for R Users

* [BRMS](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) - The BRMS package (Bayesian Regression Models using Stan)
simplifies and streamlines the use of Stan by providing an extended R formula syntax for model specification,
not unlike that of package LME4.

* [RStanArm](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/) - RStanArm provides Stan versions of other R model-fitting functions.
It provides precompiled versions of common models which are robust to sampling problems.

* [Rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) - this package accompanies the book and course materials
for [Statistical Rethinking, 2nd Ed](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9780429029608/statistical-rethinking-richard-mcelreath)
by Richard McElreath.

## Troubleshooting the Install

To help troubleshoot problems that arise when trying to use Stan,
we provide the following summary of the chain of events in conditioning a model on data and doing inference:

* Compile model
  + Stan compiler translates Stan file to C++ file
  + C++ file is compiled to executable program, via GNU Make

* Run inference algorithm
  + Interfaces run compiled executable program
  + Compiled executable generates per-chain outputs

If the program contains syntax errors, these will be caught and reported by the Stan compiler (program `stanc`).
If the Stan program is successfully translated to C++, then it should compile; error messages from the C++ compiler indicate a problem with the C++ toolchain.

If a model fails to run or appears to run slowly, this is a strong indication that the model is poorly specified given the data.
Consult the [Stan User's Guide](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/){target="_blank"} or search the [Stan Forums on Discourse](https://discourse.mc-stan.org){target="_blank"}


Common Points of failure; how to address them.

* Software download failed.
  + workaround:  check internet connectivity, disk space, and file permissions

* C++ components fail to compile
  + Workaround: we highly recommend installing using conda to create a clean environment for Stan and its toolchain.

* Stan model fails to compile with error message about a "".(PCH file)()
  + Fix:  for CmdStan based systems, rebuild CmdStan.

See CmdStan Guide section [Troubleshooting the Installation](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/installation.html#troubleshooting-the-installation){target="_blank"} for further details.
